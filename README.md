# odin-recipes
This current project is a purely-HTML website on recipes.

Starting this project, I have some knowledge on both HTML and CSS from a course on CodeAcademy, as well as some knowledge on Python, Java, C#, Blazor, and SQL from my computer science degree that is in progress.

After finishing this project, I would say that I learned more about using attributes for links and images, and I also learned about image types. This was also good practice learning and familiarizing myself with vs code shortcuts that made writing the html pages a lot faster. This was also my first time using the command line to create repos from scratch and to use the terminal to commit to github using better naming conventions (though I still need to improve). Overall, I didn't accomplish too much in terms of making a nice website, but I learned and practiced a lot along the way and I believe that I will be faster at writing html files in the future compared to before from my codeacademy lessons.
